# PROJECT-ESP32-LED-WITH-HTTP-PROTOCOL

This project was done to control the light of a house by getting the real local time by using a HTTP GET request of an 
API(https://timeapi.io/swagger/index.html). But this version is a simple one, to control a led with GPIO's of ESP32, turning
it on when is a odd minute and turning it off when is a even minute.


Dependences:
